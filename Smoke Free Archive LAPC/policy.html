    <p><h2 style="color:#cb2819">Overview</h2>
Los Angeles Pierce College is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for its students, employees, and visitors. In light of evidence that the use of tobacco and nicotine as well as exposure to secondhand smoke and aerosol <i>(commonly referred to as “vapor”)</i> from electronic smoking devices pose significant health and environmental hazards, the College has established a smoke, vapor and tobacco-free environment.

No advertising or marketing of such products shall be permitted on College property or in publications produced by the College. Except as provided below, Tobacco is not permitted on any College Owned or Leased Property, including any portions of such Property that may have been previously designated smoking areas<br>
